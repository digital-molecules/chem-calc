    st.title("QSAR")
    st.subheader("ðŸ¤” What is QSAR and why is it relevant to cheminformatics?")
    st.write("ðŸ’¡ Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) is a computational method which helps us determine the relationship between chemical structures and biological activity. It is based upon the idea that changes in bioactivity are connected to structural and molecular changes in a group of chemicals. [[1]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780443186387000025)")
    st.subheader("ðŸ¤” What are the parameters of QSAR?")
    st.write("ðŸ’¡ There are many physicochemical parameters that we can take into consideration when predicting the behaviour of a substance within a biological system. In this app, we calculate only some of them, like lipophilicity (logP), but we could also calculate the dipole moment, the pKa, the LUMO, the HOMO, and many more. [[2]](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/drug-discovery/articles/10.3389/fddsv.2024.1424402/full)")
    st.subheader("ðŸ¤” What is the SAR paradox?")
    st.write("ðŸ’¡ The reliability of QSAR methods has been challenged for well over a decade [[3]](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jm020155c). The SAR paradox refers to how structurally similar molecules may, in fact, not have similar biological properties. Thus, it is important to develop dynamic and adaptable models that can be trained with experimental data, using methods such as machine learning. [[4]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6270197/)")

    st.header("LogP")
    st.subheader("ðŸ¤” What is logP and why is it important?")
    st.write("ðŸ’¡ _Lipophilicity_ represents the compound's preference for lipid phases over aqueous ones. It plays a major role in a molecule's absorption, distribution within the body, metabolism and excretion (ADME properties), as well as its ability to penetrate biological membranes and barriers. [[5]](https://www.acdlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/download/app/physchem/making_sense.pdf) It is mathematically defined by the partition coefficient P, the measurement of the differential solubility of a compound in two immiscible solvents. *LogP* describes lipophilicity in neutral compounds only, so we should be careful to measure the logP only at a pH where the molecule is in its neutral form and not ionized. [[6]](https://www.acdlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/download/app/physchem/logp_vs_logd.pdf)")
    st.subheader("ðŸ¤” How do we interpet LogP values?")
    st.write("ðŸ’¡ Higher logP means higher lipophilicity. A negative logP value indicates that the compound is hydrophilic. A logP of zero indicates the molecule is equally dispersed among the two phases. Based on Pfizer's rule, better known as Lipinski's Rule of 5, a molecule for oral administration should have a logP of less than 5.

    st.header("TPSA")
    st.subheader("ðŸ¤” What is TPSA and why is it important?")
    st.write("ðŸ’¡ Polar Surface Area (PSA) is the sum of the contributions to the molecular van der Waals surface area of polar atoms. _Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA)_ is the simplified measurement of PSA, which helps us reduce the required computational power by avoiding the necessity to calculate ligand 3D structures or biological conformations. TPSA is an important parameter for large and diverse pharmaceutical data sets. Just like logP, it allows us to make ADME predictions. [[7]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7549127/)")
    st.subheader("ðŸ¤” How do we interpet TPSA values?")
    st.write("ðŸ’¡ In general, a drug presumed for intestinal absorption should have a TPSA of less than 140Ã…Â² and less than 90Ã…Â² if it's intended for blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration. [[8]](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5146717)")
    
    st.header("QED")
    st.subheader("ðŸ¤” What is QED and why is it important?")
    st.write("ðŸ’¡ _Quantitative Drug Likeness (QED)_ is based on 'desirability functions', which are used for multi-criteria optimizations. QED  shows us a deterministic score depending on how closely a molecule aligns with the properties of known oral pharmaceuticals. It is based on the following parameters: molecular weight (MW), lipophilicity (logP), number of hydrogen bond donors (HBD), number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA), molecular polar surface area (PSA), number of rotatable bonds (ROTB), the number of aromatic rings (AROM) and number of structural alerts (ALERTS).

    st.subheader("ðŸ¤” How do we interpet QED values?")

    st.header("Tanimoto Index")
    st.subheader("ðŸ¤” What is Tanimoto Index and why is it useful?")
    st.write("ðŸ’¡ A molecular fingerprint is a powerful and compact representation of a molecule as a binary vector, describing the presence or absence of a specific chemical property or structure within the compound [[11]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/minf.201900130). The *Tanimoto Index*, or Jaccard coefficient, divides the shared features between two molecules to the total number of unique features present in either molecule. [[12]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8479812/)")
    st.subheader("ðŸ¤” What are Morgan Fingerprints?")
    st.write("ðŸ’¡ _Morgan Fingerprints_ are based on the Morgan algorithm and were created to solve the molecular isomorphism problem - to identify when two molecules, with different atom numberings, are the same. Individual numerical identifiers are assigned to each of the atoms in a molecule, providing more accurate comparisons compared to Daylight fingerprints. [[13]](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ci100050t)")
    st.subheader("ðŸ¤” How do we interpet the results of the comparison?")

    st.subheader("ðŸ¤” What is 'Lipinski's Rule of 5'?")
    st.write("ðŸ’¡ _Lipinski's Rule of 5'_ says that '**poor** absorption and permeation are more likely when there are more than 5 H-bond donors, the molecular weight is over 500Da, the logP is over 5 and there are more than 10 H-bond acceptors' and that 'compound classes that are substrates for biological transporters are exceptions to the rule.' [[14]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169409X96004231) We should be careful when using it, as it is not intended to exclude molecules from being potential orally administered drug candidates, but rather to serve as a guideline.")
