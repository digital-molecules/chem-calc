It is based upon the idea that changes in bioactivity are connected to structural and molecular changes in a group of chemicals.

In this app, we calculate only some of them, like lipophilicity (logP), but we could also calculate the dipole moment, the pKa, the LUMO, the HOMO, and many more.

    st.write("ðŸ’¡ The reliability of QSAR methods have been challenged for well over a decade [[3]](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jm020155c). The SAR paradox refers to the fact that structurally similar molecules may, in fact, not have similar biological properties. Thus, it is important to develop dynamic and adaptable models that can be trained with experimental data, using methods such as machine learning.
