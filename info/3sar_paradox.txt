ðŸ’¡ The reliability of QSAR methods has been challenged for well over a decade [[3]](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jm020155c). The SAR paradox refers to how structurally similar molecules may, in fact, not have similar biological properties. Thus, it is important to develop dynamic and adaptable models that can be trained with experimental data, using methods such as machine learning.
