ðŸ’¡ _Morgan Fingerprints_ are based on the Morgan algorithm and were created to solve the molecular isomorphism problem â€” to identify when two molecules, with different atom numberings, are the same. Individual numerical identifiers are assigned to each of the atoms in a molecule, providing more accurate comparisons compared to Daylight fingerprints.
