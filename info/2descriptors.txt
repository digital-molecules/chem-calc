ðŸ’¡ There are many parameters, also known as descriptors, that we can take into consideration when predicting the behaviour of a substance within a biological system. In this app, we calculate only some of them, like lipophilicity (logP), but we could also calculate other physicochemical descriptors like the dipole moment and the pKa, or electronic descriptors like the LUMO and the HOMO, and many more.
