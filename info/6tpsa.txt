ðŸ’¡ Polar Surface Area (PSA) is the sum of the contributions to the molecular van der Waals surface area of polar atoms. _Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA)_ is the simplified measurement of PSA, which helps us reduce the required computational power by avoiding the necessity to calculate ligand 3D structures or biological conformations. TPSA is an important topological descriptor for large and diverse pharmaceutical data sets. Just like logP, it allows us to make ADME predictions.
