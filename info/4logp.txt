ðŸ’¡ Lipophilicity represents the compound's preference for lipid phases over aqueous ones. It's a physicochemical property and it plays a major role in a molecule's absorption, distribution within the body, metabolism and excretion (ADME properties), as well as its ability to penetrate biological membranes and barriers. [[5]](https://www.acdlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/download/app/physchem/making_sense.pdf) It is mathematically defined by the partition coefficient P, the measurement of the differential solubility of a compound in two immiscible solvents. *LogP* describes lipophilicity in neutral compounds only, so we should be careful to measure the logP only at a pH where the molecule is in its neutral form and not ionized.
