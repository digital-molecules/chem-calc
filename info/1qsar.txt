ðŸ’¡ Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) is the main pillar of ligand-based drug design (LBDD). It is a computational method which helps us determine the relationship between chemical structures and biological activity. QSAR is based upon the idea that changes in bioactivity are connected to structural and molecular changes in a group of chemicals.
