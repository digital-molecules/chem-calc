ðŸ’¡ _Lipinski's Rule of 5_ says, in regards to a drug's oral bioavailability, that "**poor** absorption and permeation are more likely when there are more than 5 H-bond donors, the molecular weight is over 500Da, the logP is over 5 and there are more than 10 H-bond acceptors" and that "compound classes that are substrates for biological transporters are exceptions to the rule." [[14]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169409X96004231) We should be careful when using it, as it is not intended to exclude molecules from being potential orally administered drug candidates, but rather to serve as a guideline for the design of such pharmaceuticals.
