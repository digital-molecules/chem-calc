ðŸ’¡ A molecular fingerprint is structural descriptor and a powerful and compact representation of a molecule as a binary vector, describing the presence or absence of a specific chemical property or structure within the compound. [[11]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/minf.201900130) The *Tanimoto Index*, or Jaccard coefficient, divides the shared features between two molecules to the total number of unique features present in either molecule.
