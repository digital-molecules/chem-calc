This app was written in PyCharm.

Make sure you install the 'rdkit' and 'streamlit' libraries using the 'pip install' command.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the app to run independently from the IDE, you may need to install rdkit with conda and add it to requirements.txt along with streamlit
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Errors in main.py that return 0 are due to PyCharm's lack of configuration for testing Streamlit code, and you can ignore them. If test_chem.py runs normally, there should be no other issues.
