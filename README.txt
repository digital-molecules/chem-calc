
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This app was written in PyCharm.

Make sure you install the 'rdkit' and 'streamlit' libraries using the 'pip install' command.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the app to run independently from the IDE, you may need to install rdkit with conda and add it to requirements.txt along with streamlit
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As long as you run main.py through PyCharm's GUI and it returns 0, you can run the app using the typical command ('streamlit run main.py') on the terminal. Such errors are due to PyCharm's lack of configuration for testing Streamlit code, and you can ignore them. If test_chem.py runs normally, there should be no other issues.
