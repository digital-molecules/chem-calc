
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This app was written using PyCharm.

Make sure you install the 'rdkit' and 'streamlit' libraries using the 'pip install' command.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the app to run independently from the IDE, you should install rdkit manually with conda and add it to the requirements.txt file
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As long as you run the code through PyCharm's GUI and it returns 0, you can run the app using the typical commands (streamlit run main.py) on the terminal. If PyCharm shows errors but the app runs fine, this is due to lack of configuration on PyCharm's part that allows it to properly test Streamlit code. You can ignore these errors as long as 0 is returned. There should be no other particular issues.
